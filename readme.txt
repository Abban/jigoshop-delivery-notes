-- Base Usage

Once installed you will see a Delivery Note Settings link appear under the orders section of the WP admin navigation.
The settings are pretty basic allowing you to add a few fields that are applied to the template.

If you click on Orders then click on any order you will see a delivery note box appear on the right hand side of the page with 
a button saying "View & Print Delivery Note". If you click on this you will get the default template you then click File and print in your browser
and you will have a delivery note.

-- Custom Templates

If you want to use your own template then all you need to do is copy the /wp-content/plugins/jigoshop-delivery-notes/delivery-note folder and paste it
inside your themes/jigoshop folder. The folder comes with the default template and the basic CSS file. You can modifiy this until your heart is
content.
